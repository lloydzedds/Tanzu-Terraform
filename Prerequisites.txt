To use the Tanzu Mission Control provider for Terraform, you must have access to Tanzu Mission Control through an VMware Cloud services organization. Prior to initializing this provider in Terraform, make sure you have the following information:

The endpoint for your Tanzu Mission Control organization.
An active API token.
To gather this information, you need to do the following:

Log in to the Tanzu Mission Control console.

After you have logged in, the domain in the URL displayed in your browser represents the endpoint for your organization.

For example, the URL for the Clusters page in the Tanzu Mission Control console is something like this:

my-org.tmc.cloud.vmware.com/clusters

Here, the endpoint is my-org.tmc.cloud.vmware.com

In the Tanzu Mission Control console, click on your name in the top right corner, and then click My Account.

On the My Account page of the VMware Cloud Services console, click the API Tokens tab.

From this page, you can generate a new API token, and then copy it to use for the Tanzu Mission Control provider in Terraform.
